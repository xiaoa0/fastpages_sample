    "### Dynamic Example\n",
    "This example starts to use Java in its natural manner, using an object within the main method. This example is a very basic illustration of Object Oriente Programming (OOP). The main method is now used as a driver/tester, by making an instance of the class.  Thus, it creates an Object using the HelloObject() constructor.  Also, this Class contains a getter method called getHello() which returns the value with the \"String hello\".\n",

    "### Dynamic Example with two constructors\n",
    "This last example adds to the basics of the Java anatomy.  The Class now contains two constructors and a setter to go with the getter.  Also, observe the driver/tester now contains two objects that are initialized differently, 0 and 1 argument constructor.  Look at the usage of the \"this\" prefix.  The \"this\" keyword helps in clarification between instance and local variable.\n",

    "The key terms in HelloDynamic introduction:\n",
    "- \"0 argument constructor\" constructor method with no parameter ()\n",
    "- \"1 argument constructor\" construct method with a parameter (String hello)\n",
    "- \"this keyword\" allows you to clear reference something that is part of the object, data or method\n",
    "- \"local variable\" is a variable that is passed to the method in this example, see the 1 argument constructor as it has a local variable \"String hello\"\n",
    "- \"dynamic\" versus \"static\" is something that has option to change, static never changes.  A class (blueprint) and objects (instance of blueprint) are generally intended to be dynamic.  Constructors and Setters are used to dynamically change the content of an object.\n",
